# COM Research

A collection of random bits of COM research and POC code.


- shellex.cpp + VS Project
  - Example code to show how to interact with COM methods using IDispatch in C++. I've included the full Visual Stuido project for easier import/testing.
  
- clsids.txt
  - A list of CLSIDs compiled from a test system and here - https://www.scriptjunkie.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iids_tiraniddo
  - The clsids-crash.txt file contains ids that were unstable.
